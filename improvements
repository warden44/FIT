Issues with drag and drop
When dropping, receiving container doesnt know which container is sending, just assumes the task list.
Dragged items must be dropped on other items, and cannot be dropped on the background inbetween.
Get error every once in a while when drag and dropping

reduce parameters in move functions and base recevingList and setReceivingList on ToListName?
