//onpress and onLongPress workarounds
there is an onTouchStart and onTouchEnd, you could start timer define a touch
there is also an onTouchMove, maybe you could see do a long press by making sure the item isnt moving

//For using slices
You can change everything from the moveItem and moveTeam functions into the reducers of the lists. The onRecieveDragDrop fucntion would need to know the from list and to list. The from list comes from payload, to list will be hard coded into the component or set as a parameter if its an actual component. Can we just put the reducer function to remove item from the from list in the payload?

steps Create slices, create reducer, use redux state in enroute loadout, call reducer in the ondragdrop


//Reduction/Cleaning
Implement redux to manage and clean lists so they can be in their own file
reduce components into multiple functions that use redux to update state
find way to make global functions that the different components can share
Join sections into one main screen
delete duplicate styles
turn checkboxes into components
turn mayday into component


//As Requested by Chief
Title components
Find way to organize dropdown list
allow multiple teams to be on a tChart
Flashing benchmarks - flash one by one until tapped, checkable checks all
Move timer top
Time touchable, not automated
two Fire attacks, rehabs
two tasks per tChart? ask
ability to free write a task



make text of radio button clickable, not just the button itself
make setting a bubble option also check off the corresponding check box
make bubbles bigger
match existing colors of white board
set opacity of tcharts to low if not being used
currentList of todo list needs to be todo, not task
fix snapback animation when pushing to done? idk this sounds hard af

Issues with drag and drop
When dropping, receiving container doesnt know which container is sending, just assumes the task list.
Dragged items must be dropped on other items, and cannot be dropped on the background inbetween.
Get error every once in a while when drag and dropping

reduce parameters in move functions and base recevingList and setReceivingList on ToListName?
