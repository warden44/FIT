//Things to improve

//For using slices
You can change everything from the moveItem and moveTeam functions into the reducers of the lists. The onRecieveDragDrop fucntion would need to know the from list and to list. The from list comes from payload, to list will be hard coded into the component or set as a parameter if its an actual component. Can we just put the reducer function to remove item from the from list in the payload?

steps Create slices, create reducer, use redux state in enroute loadout, call reducer in the ondragdrop


//Reduction/Cleaning

Issues with drag and drop
When dropping, receiving container doesnt know which container is sending, just assumes the task list.
Dragged items must be dropped on other items, and cannot be dropped on the background inbetween.
Get error every once in a while when drag and dropping

reduce parameters in move functions and base recevingList and setReceivingList on ToListName?
